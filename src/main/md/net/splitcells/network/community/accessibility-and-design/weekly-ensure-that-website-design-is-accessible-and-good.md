# Ensure that the website design is accessible and good
* Issue number: [\#43](https://codeberg.org/splitcells-net/net.splitcells.network.community/issues/43)
# Task Description
Improve the design, accessibility and usability of the software.

Starting with [2025](https://www.golem.de/news/barrierefreiheit-deutsche-webseiten-sind-versetzungsgefaehrdet-2409-188655.html)
public website should be barrierefrei.
Although, this law does not seem to apply to `splitcells.net`,
this is an opportunity to consider this aspect.
# Service Tasks
* [ ] Check warnings and errors in the browser.
# Tasks
* [ ] All rendered READMEs have the same content on the website.
* [ ] In web layout add link from primary column to secondary column.
* [ ] Improve styling of low priority buttons of chapters. 
* [ ] Consider using pastel color palette for none black and white colors.
* [ ] Consider add paper folding or origami as CSS style for background, as decoration.
* [ ] Consider using pure e4 without RCP as GUI instead of JavaFX,
  as this uses the operating system's browser,
  which is better than JavaFX's embedded Chromium.
  The Chromium has some strange icons and other differences.
  These are not game breakers, but make things more ugly.
# Completed Tasks
* [x] Make white bold structural guidelines less thick, as these distract a bit too much.
* [x] Prefer using always darkest black color as text color,
  in order to improve contrast.
  -> The lower priority font colors where made more black and therefore readable.
