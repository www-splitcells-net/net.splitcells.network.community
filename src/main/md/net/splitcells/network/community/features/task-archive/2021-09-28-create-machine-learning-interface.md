# Create machine learning interface
- [ ] Integrate [dl4j](https://github.com/eclipse/deeplearning4j) for demo purposes.
  This could be used for the constraint group based repair.
  This th most interesting, because it is an Eclipse project.
    - [ ] Contact Eclipse people about the results.
- [ ] Try out [Deep Java Libarary](https://github.com/deepjavalibrary/djl). It may be the easier to setup, because it has ready to go network models.
  The  Multilayer Perceptron (`ai.djl.basicmodelzoo.basic.Mlp`) seems to be an easily configurable network.
