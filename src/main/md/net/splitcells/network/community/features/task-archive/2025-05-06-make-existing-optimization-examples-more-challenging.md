# Make existing optimization examples more challenging.
# Task Description
Currently, the existing school problem inputs are too easy and
probably even not that realistic.
The primary goal is to find out, how good the solver scales with bigger and
harder inputs for existing problems.
Furthermore, the solver's scalability and runtime performance is to be improved.
# Tasks
* [ ] Where is the school exam problem?
    * [ ] Minimize the number of days the teacher has free time between tests.
