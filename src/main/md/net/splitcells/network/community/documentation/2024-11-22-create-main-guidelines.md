# Create main guidelines

# Task Description
* [ ] Create short manifesto like main guidelines,
  where all more complex guidelines have to link to the corresponding guidelines of the manifesto.
    * [ ] Require that any thing like code needs a reasoning, why it exists.
      This is especially important for CSS styling.

      makes it possible for foreigners to continue the reasoning of a certain part of the project.
    * [ ] Consider using old quotes to decorate documentation.
    * [ ] Write the reasoning in the form of a perfect discussion, when the reasoning is about something
      , that evolved over time.
    * [ ] Link main guidelines and main objects. See these as functional and non-functional objectives.
