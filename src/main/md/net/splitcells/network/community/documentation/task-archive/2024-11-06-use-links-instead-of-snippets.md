# Use Links Instead of Snippets
In the future, documentation files that show how to code something,
should not have a snippet of source code in them.
Instead, these should contain links to the fitting source code files.
The website renderer than transforms such links into code snippets.
This avoids showing old and invalid code in the documentation.
