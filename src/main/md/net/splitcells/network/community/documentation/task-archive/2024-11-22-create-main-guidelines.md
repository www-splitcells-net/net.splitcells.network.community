# Create main guidelines

# Task Description
* [ ] Create short manifesto like main guidelines,
  where all more complex guidelines have to link to the corresponding guidelines of the manifesto.
    * [ ] Require that any thing like code needs a reasoning, why it exists.
      This is especially important for CSS styling.
      View reasoning as a thing, that connects code to semantics and
      makes it possible for foreigners to continue the reasoning of a certain part of the project.
    * [ ] Consider using old quotes to decorate documentation.
    * [ ] Write the reasoning in the form of a perfect discussion, when the reasoning is about something
      , that evolved over time.
    * [ ] Link main guidelines and main objects. See these as functional and non-functional objectives.
    * [ ] Art as a strategy to avoid to complex functionality by allowing the brain to do something fancy less damaging instead.
    * [ ] Naming of top level projects in relation to Java's package structure: 
      Use only one word or abbreviation and accept, that its meaning can drift, contract or expand.
      Do not use multiple words separated by dots as it causes organizational and structural problems.
