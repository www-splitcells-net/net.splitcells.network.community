# Support FlatZinc
* [ ] Link relevant site like: https://www.minizinc.org/
* [ ] Document, that this is the main feature how interoperability for optimization is supported.
* [ ] This is also the main effort to support of modelling optimization problems as CSPs.
* [ ] Optimize problems given FlatZinc format.
* [ ] Delegate optimization by emitting problem in FlatZinc format and optimize it via a solver, that supports FlatZinc.
* [ ] Use FlatZinc in order to solve sub problems present in the constraint based repairer.
* [ ] Start competition agains other Java optimizer via Mini/FlatZinc. -> Choco Solver as main competitor

- [ ] Make Gel compatible to MiniZinc.
- [ ] Find benchmarking software for MiniZinc: https://github.com/MiniZinc/mzn-bench
- [ ] Do some benchmarking.

# Ideas
* [ ] Take part in public challenges: https://www.minizinc.org/challenge2022/results2022.html
* [ ] Create permanent interaction with MiniZinc.
