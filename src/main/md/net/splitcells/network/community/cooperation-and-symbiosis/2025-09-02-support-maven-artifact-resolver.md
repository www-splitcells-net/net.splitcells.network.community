# Support Maven Artifact Resolver
* Repo: https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver
# Task Description
I want to support an open source project,
that is a basis for technologies I am using.
I consider having a connection between this project and the outside
will have positive learning and social networking effects.

This is a very low priority task and
therefore the focus is on the community and code reviews.
# Service Tasks

* Review pull requests: https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver/pulls
# Acceptance Note
This task is canceled for now, as supporting/contributing to an external project regarding errors,
that do not happen locally as well takes too much time.
