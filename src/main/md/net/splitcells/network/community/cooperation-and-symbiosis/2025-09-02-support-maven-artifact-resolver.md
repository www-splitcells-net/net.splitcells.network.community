# Support Maven Artifact Resolver
* Repo: https://github.com/apache/maven-resolver
# Task Description
I want to support an open source project,
that is a basis for technologies I am using.
I consider having a connection between this project and the outside
will have positive learning and network effects.

This is a very low priority task and
therefore the focus is on the community and code reviews.
