    * [ ] Add option to action menu in order to move element.
      When clicked, every possible target location should get 2 temporary button.
      One states, that the element should be placed before the target location, and
      the other states, that the element should be placed after the target location.
      Currently, the server needs to be restarted by hand for this.
* [ ] Only provide functions etc. in add/append/set actions, that can be technically used and are technically valid.
* [ ] Make it easy to write arguments of new function call, without the need for many clicks.
