# Sigma Grind starting from March 4th to March 16th
Moving closer to a full synergy between the subprojects.
# Tasks
* [ ] [Create a unified backend for editor, which will be the basis for the optimization network.](../features/2024-11-13-t37-solve-sport-lesson-assignment.md)
  This makes it easier to introduce a new grammar while supporting the existing input code and with minimized code duplication.
    * [ ] Implement syntax to domain mapping.
        * [ ] Constraint 
    * [ ] Visualize error location. Currently, `*Description.toString()` has no visualization of its content.
      The visualization of each description should correspond with the fitting user input part.
    * [ ] Test unified backend.

    * [ ] Try to get the deployment to the live server working via a Java based Network worker execution.
    * [ ] Create unit tests for the Java based Network worker execution.
* [ ] [Establish symbiosis strategy.](../cooperation-and-symbiosis/2025-03-01-establish-symbiosis-strategy.md)
    * [ ] Integrate symbiosis project into objectives, even though the status of symbiosis is questionable.
* [ ] [Consider compatibility with git-repo-manager.](../cooperation-and-symbiosis/2022-10-25-consider-compatibility-with-git-repo-manager.md)
* [ ] Import and export input data in Gel editor.
* [o] Fix Gel UI's no-code editor. -> The no-code editor is deprecated.
* [ ] Explain, what the Splitcells Network is.
* [ ] Deprecate the no-code editor, as the duplicate editor don't provide real gains given the no-code editors complexity.
    * [ ] Remove it from the front menu.
    * [ ] Adjust code editor name in front menu.
