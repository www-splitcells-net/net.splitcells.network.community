# Grind of 2026.02.09
* [x] Maintenance cycle.
* [ ] Get all cluster tests running and the results pushed to the network log.
    * [ ] Fix RISC-V server.
    * [x] Test Live Server.
    * [x] Test Raspberry PI.
    * [ ] Test RISC-V server.
* [x] Support repo synchronization with on command.
  Currently, 2 commands `net.splitcells.network.bom.repo.pull` and `repo.push.at.all` are required,
  as dependencies can be updated.
  -> `repos.synchronize` does the job. For easier use it was simplified, so the command assumes, that nothing is left for commit.
  Thereby unintended commits with bad generic messages are avoided.
* [ ] Start `repos.process.v2`, which does its execution by generating shell scripts.
  This makes tests easier in the future.
  Define environment variable for `repos.process`, in order to delicate the calls to it to the new `repos.process.v2`.
  When everything is ready the old implementation is replaced by the new one.
* [ ] Work on [sport lesson assignment](../../features/2024-11-13-t37-solve-sport-lesson-assignment.md).
