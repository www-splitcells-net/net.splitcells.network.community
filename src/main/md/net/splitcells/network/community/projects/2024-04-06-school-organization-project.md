# Project for supporting scheduling at schools 
## Introduction
The division of labor symbolized by the assembly line is one of the most iconic aspects of industrialization.
Instead of workers being responsible for building a product from start to finish,
workers specialize on specific steps of the production.
The resulting higher productivity comes with an increased coordination effort,
since each step of the production can be completed by an ever smaller proportion of the workers.
The increasing coordination effort led to a new industry of mechanized data processing,
to keep up with the ever-increasing data processing.

In the spirit of this division of labor,
the goal of the project is to provide a non-profit software,
that domain experts use to model and optimize schedules.
For this, the software provides specialized modeling and optimization capacities in an understandable manner.
