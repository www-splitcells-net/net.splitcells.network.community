# Consolidating the project's focus.
> It is essential to understand, what is really important for oneself.

2021 I limited the software's functionality, in order to create a first release.
Over time a too wide feature creep started.
Instead of finishing the basics regarding the school scheduling,
the no-code editor and the Crisis Network project were introduced.

Especially the Crisis Network project caused issues.
It is a canvas, that combines different optimization problems, in order to model and simulate a single and complex world.
It can be thought as a game, where every component is an optimization problem.
Instead of programming and solving small unrelated optimizations without any meaning,
one could work on small projects, that add semantic meaning to an existing world.
It is way to motivate one to work on something meaningful and not to just solve optimal symbol processing.

The Crisis Network will be done in the future,
as the software is not ready to model space time as an optimization problem performance wise for now.
Crisis Network showed, that alot is already possible, but every step required a lot of work,
as many helper functions and fine-tuning are missing.

I also cancelled the project of providing a scheduler for schools in real life,
as coordinating such a project with schools  would require a lot of time and resources.
Furthermore, I would first have to find a fitting school and
the more I think about it, the more this seems to be out of scope for the Network project for now.

Instead, I am focusing on creating a proper optimization IDE and solving the advanced school scheduling problems.
The optimization IDE aka code editor is required,
so users can properly model the advanced school scheduling problems without using Java and Maven.
The goal is to not just enable software developers to use the program,
but to make the platform usable for domain experts, too.
Only after this is, the Crisis Network will be attempted.
