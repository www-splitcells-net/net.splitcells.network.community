# No-Code Editor
> Distracting myself from the main goal.

After creating the [code editor](https://live.splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/ui/editor.html)
for the Generic Allocator (Gel),
I developed the [no-code editor](https://live.splitcells.net/net/splitcells/gel/ui/no/code/editor/index.html)
for Gel as well.

There were 2 primary purposes for no-code.
1. First, this lessened the amount of knowledge needed by the user to define optimization problems.
  The user would not need to know the syntax of the modelling language exactly and could be sure,
  that there are no syntax errors in the optimization problem's definition.
  Furthermore, the user would even be able to discover the language just by clicking through the editor.
  The editor itself would provide all information about the possibilities of the modelling language.
2. Second, the developer could avoid some amount of documentation regarding the modelling language's grammar,
  that is syntax specific.
  Such documentation would also be relatively hard to change,
  when the syntax changes compared to the no-code alternative,
  where the documentation can focus more on the contents of the modelling language.
