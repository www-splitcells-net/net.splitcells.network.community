# Boostrap behaviour driven development (BDD).
# Task Description
BDD is a static log/event framework,
where each log message or event is statically typed.

This could also be used, in order to prevent from certain messages being sent multiple times.
Like a message, that a certain feature is not implemented.
For such warning and error message a report would be needed,
in order to be useful.

This also can be viewed as a basis for condensing the log size.

Later this can be used to do BDD testing.
