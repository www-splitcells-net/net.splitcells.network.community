# Interesting Developers
* [Linus Torvals](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/CAHk-=wgg2A_iHNwf_JDjYJF=XHnKVGOjGp50FzVWniA2Z010bw@mail.gmail.com/) has excellent discussions about C code, that can be relevant for none C developers as well.
  Is there a central feed, where one can follow all social media messages, which includes mailing lists, by Linus xD ?
