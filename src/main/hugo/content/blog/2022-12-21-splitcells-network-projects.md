# Notes
* This is a ticket system in the form of a blog.
  A simplified and therefore easily portable folder structure is preferred. 
* Generally speaking all tickets should be reachable via this blog.
* This blog is only used for complex or important tickets, that may create lasting requirements.
  It may also be used for tickets, were its reasoning is important or complex and therefore needs to be documented.
  Other tickets are linked from this blog.
* A dedicated Git repo is used in order to avoid problems caused by polluting other repos.
  As this repo is about any ticket related to network projects,
  this also avoids commits to other Git repos,
  which contains tickets unrelated to the other Git repos.
